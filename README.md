A login form web page created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It integrates with an open login API and includes client-side form validation. 
The login page is fully responsive and works well on both web and mobile devices.

Features
 - Responsive design: The login form adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a great user experience on both desktop and mobile.
 - Form validation: Checks if the email format is valid and ensures the password has at least 6 characters.
 - API integration: Sends a POST request to an open login API upon form submission.
 - Show/Hide password: Allows users to toggle the visibility of the password.
 - Remember Me: Option to remember user credentials (for future enhancement).
